# Process Data with a Custom JAR<a name="UseCase_CustomJar"></a>

A custom JAR runs a compiled Java program that you upload to Amazon S3\. Compile the program against the version of Hadoop you want to launch and submit a CUSTOM\_JAR step to your Amazon EMR cluster\. For more information about compiling a JAR file, see [Build Binaries Using Amazon EMR](emr-build-binaries.md)\.
