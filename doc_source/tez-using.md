# Using Tez<a name="tez-using"></a>

The following examples show you how to use Tez for the data and scripts used in the tutorial [Getting Started: Analyzing Big Data with Amazon EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs.html) shown in [Step 3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs-prepare-data-and-script.html)\.

**Compare the Hive runtimes of MapReduce vs\. Tez**

1. Create a cluster as shown in the procedure called [To create a cluster with Tez installed using the console](tez-create-cluster.md#emr-tez-create)\. Choose **Hive** as an application in addition to **Tez**\.

1. Connect to the cluster master node using SSH\. For more information, see [Connect to the Master Node Using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-master-node-ssh.html)\.

1. Run the `Hive_CloudFront.q` script using MapReduce with the following command, where *region* is the region in which your cluster is located:

   ```
   hive -f s3://region.elasticmapreduce.samples/cloudfront/code/Hive_CloudFront.q \
   -d INPUT=s3://region.elasticmapreduce.samples -d OUTPUT=s3://myBucket/mr-test/
   ```

   

   The output should look something like the following:

   ```

   ```

1. Using a text editor, replace the `hive.execution.engine` value with `tez` in `/etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml`\.

1. Kill the HiveServer2 process with the following command:

   ```
   sudo kill -9 $(pgrep -f HiveServer2)
   ```

   Upstart automatically restarts the Hive server with your configuration changes loaded\.

1. Now run the job with the Tez execution engine using the following command:

   ```
   hive -f s3://region.elasticmapreduce.samples/cloudfront/code/Hive_CloudFront.q \
   -d INPUT=s3://region.elasticmapreduce.samples -d OUTPUT=s3://myBucket/tez-test/
   ```

   The output should look something like the following:

   ```

   The time to run the same application took approximately 20 seconds \(40%\) less time using Tez\.
