# Amazon EMR Notebook based on Jupyter Notebook<a name="emr-jupyter-emr-managed-notebooks"></a>

EMR Notebooks is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment built in to the Amazon EMR console that allows you to quickly create Jupyter notebooks, attach them to Spark clusters, and then open the Jupyter Notebook editor in the console to remotely run queries and code\. An EMR notebook is saved in Amazon S3 independently from clusters for durable storage, quick access, and flexibility\. You can have multiple notebooks open, attach multiple notebooks to a single cluster, and re\-use a notebook on different clusters\.
