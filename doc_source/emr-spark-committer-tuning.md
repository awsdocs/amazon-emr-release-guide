# Job Tuning Considerations<a name="emr-spark-committer-tuning"></a>

The EMRFS S3\-optimized committer consumes a small amount of memory for each file written by a task attempt until the task gets committed or aborted\. In most jobs, the amount of memory consumed is negligible\. For jobs that have long\-running tasks that write a large number of files, the memory that the committer consumes may be noticeable and require adjustments to the memory allocated for Spark executors\. You can tune executor memory using the `spark.executor.memory` property\. As a guideline, a single task writing 100,000 files would typically require an additional 100MB of memory\. For more information, see [Application Properties](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#application-properties) in the Apache Spark Configuration documentation\.
