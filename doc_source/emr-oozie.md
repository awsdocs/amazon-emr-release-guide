# Apache Oozie<a name="emr-oozie"></a>

Use the Apache Oozie Workflow Scheduler to manage and coordinate Hadoop jobs\. For more information, see [http://oozie\.apache\.org/](http://oozie.apache.org/)\.

The Oozie native web interface is not supported on Amazon EMR\. To use a front\-end interface for Oozie, try the Hue Oozie application\. For more information, see [Hue](emr-hue.md)\. Oozie is included with Amazon EMR release version 5\.0\.0 and later\. Oozie is included as a sandbox application in earlier releases\. For more information, see [Amazon EMR 4\.x Release Versions](emr-release-4x.md)\.

If you use a custom Amazon Linux AMI based on an Amazon Linux AMI with a creation date of 2018\-08\-11, the Oozie server fails to start\. If you use Oozie, create a custom AMI based on an Amazon Linux AMI ID with a different creation date\. You can use the following AWS CLI command to return a list of Image IDs for all HVM Amazon Linux AMIs with a 2018\.03 version, along with the release date, so that you can choose an appropriate Amazon Linux AMI as your base\. Replace MyRegion with your region identifier, such as us\-west\-2\.

```
aws ec2 --region MyRegion describe-images --owner amazon --query 'Images[?Name!=`null`]|[?starts_with(Name, `amzn-ami-hvm-2018.03`) == `true`].[CreationDate,ImageId,Name]' --output text | sort -rk1
```
