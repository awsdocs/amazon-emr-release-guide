# Apache Flink<a name="emr-flink"></a>

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) is a streaming dataflow engine that you can use to run real\-time stream processing on high\-throughput data sources\. Flink supports event time semantics for out\-of\-order events, exactly\-once semantics, backpressure control, and APIs optimized for writing both streaming and batch applications\.

Additionally, Flink has connectors for third\-party data sources, such as the following:
+ [Amazon Kinesis Streams](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/streaming/connectors/kinesis.html)
+ [Apache Kafka](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/streaming/connectors/kafka.html)
+ [Elasticsearch](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/streaming/connectors/elasticsearch2.html)
+ [Twitter Streaming API](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.2/dev/connectors/twitter.html)
+ [Cassandra](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/apis/streaming/connectors/cassandra.html)

Amazon EMR supports Flink as a YARN application so that you can manage resources along with other applications within a cluster\. Flink\-on\-YARN allows you to submit transient Flink jobs, or you can create a long\-running cluster that accepts multiple jobs and allocates resources according to the overall YARN reservation\.

Flink is included in Amazon EMR release versions 5\.1\.0 and later\.

**Note**  
Support for the `FlinkKinesisConsumer` class was added in Amazon EMR release version 5\.2\.1\.
