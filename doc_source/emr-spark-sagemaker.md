# Use Amazon SageMaker Spark for machine learning<a name="emr-spark-sagemaker"></a>

When using Amazon EMR release version 5\.11\.0 and later, the `aws-sagemaker-spark-sdk` component is installed along with Spark\. This component installs Amazon SageMaker Spark and associated dependencies for Spark integration with [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\. You can use Amazon SageMaker Spark to construct Spark machine learning \(ML\) pipelines using Amazon SageMaker stages\. For more information, see the [Amazon SageMaker Spark readme](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-spark/blob/master/README.md) on GitHub and [Using Apache Spark with Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/apache-spark.html) in the *Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide*\.
