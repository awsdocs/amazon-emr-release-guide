# JupyterHub<a name="emr-jupyterhub"></a>

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open\-source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text\. [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) allows you to host multiple instances of a single\-user Jupyter notebook server\. When you create a cluster with JupyterHub, Amazon EMR creates a Docker container on the cluster's master node\. JupyterHub, all the components required for Jupyter, and [Sparkmagic](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/sparkmagic/blob/master/README.md) run within the container\.

Sparkmagic is a library of kernels that allows Jupyter notebooks to interact with [Apache Spark](https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/what-is-spark/) running on Amazon EMR through [Apache Livy](emr-livy.md), which is a REST server for Spark\. Spark and Apache Livy are installed automatically when you create a cluster with JupyterHub\. The default Python 3 kernel for Jupyter is available along with the PySpark 3, PySpark, and Spark kernels that are available with Sparkmagic\. You can use these kernels to run ad\-hoc Spark code and interactive SQL queries using Python and Scala\. You can install additional kernels within the Docker container manually\. For more information, see [Installing Additional Kernels and Libraries](emr-jupyterhub-install-kernels-libs.md)\.

The following diagram depicts the components of JupyterHub on Amazon EMR with corresponding authentication methods for notebook users and the administrator\. For more information, see [Adding Jupyter Notebook Users and Administrators](emr-jupyterhub-user-access.md)\.
