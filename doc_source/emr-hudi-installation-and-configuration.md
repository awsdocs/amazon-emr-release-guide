# Create a cluster with Hudi installed<a name="emr-hudi-installation-and-configuration"></a>

With Amazon EMR release version 5\.28\.0 and later, Amazon EMR installs Hudi components by default when Spark, Hive, or Presto is installed\. To use Hudi on Amazon EMR, create a cluster with one or more of the following applications installed:
+ Hadoop
+ Hive
+ Spark
+ Presto
+ Flink

You can create a cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon EMR API\.
