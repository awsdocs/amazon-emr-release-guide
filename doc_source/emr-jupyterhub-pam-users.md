# Using PAM authentication<a name="emr-jupyterhub-pam-users"></a>

Creating PAM users in JupyterHub on Amazon EMR is a two\-step process\. The first step is to add users to the operating system running in the `jupyterhub` container on the master node, and to add a corresponding user home directory for each user\. The second step is to add these operating system users as JupyterHub usersâ€”a process known as whitelisting in JupyterHub\. After a JupyterHub user is added, they can connect to the JupyterHub URL and provide their operating system credentials for access\.

When a user logs in, JupyterHub opens the notebook server instance for that user, which is saved in the user's home directory on the master node, which is `/var/lib/jupyter/home/username`\. If a notebook server instance doesn't exist, JupyterHub spawns a notebook instance in the user's home directory\. The following sections demonstrate how to add users individually to the operating system and to JupyterHub, followed by a rudimentary bash script that adds multiple users\.

## Adding an operating system user to the container<a name="emr-jupyterhub-system-user"></a>

The following example first uses the [useradd](https://linux.die.net/man/8/useradd) command within the container to add a single user, diego, and create a home directory for that user\. The second command uses [chpasswd](https://linux.die.net/man/8/chpasswd) to establish a password of diego for this user\. Commands are run on the master node command line while connected using SSH\. You could also run these commands using a step as described earlier in [Administration by submitting steps](emr-jupyterhub-administer.md#emr-jupyterhub-administer-steps)\.

```
sudo docker exec jupyterhub useradd -m -s /bin/bash -N diego
sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "echo diego:diego | chpasswd"
```

## Adding a JupyterHub user<a name="emr-jupyterhub-jupyterhub-user"></a>

You can use the **Admin** panel in JupyterHub or the REST API to add users and administrators, or just users\.

**To add users and administrators using the admin panel in JupyterHub**

1. Connect to the master node using SSH and log in to https://*MasterNodeDNS*:9443 with an identity that has administrator permissions\.

1. Choose **Control Panel**, **Admin**\.

1. Choose **User**, **Add Users**, or choose **Admin**, **Add Admins**\.

**To add a user using the REST API**

1. Connect to the master node using SSH and use the following command on the master node, or run the command as a step\.

1. Acquire an administrative token to make API requests, and replace *AdminToken* in the following step with that token\.

1. Use the following command, replacing *UserName* with an operating system user that has been created within the container\.

   ```
   curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: token AdminToken" "https://$(hostname):9443/hub/api/users/UserName
   ```

## Example: Bash script to add multiple users<a name="emr-jupyterhub-script-multuser"></a>

The following sample bash script ties together the previous steps in this section to create multiple JupyterHub users\. The script can be run directly on the master node, or it can be uploaded to Amazon S3 and then run as a step\.

The script first establishes an array of user names, and uses the `jupyterhub token` command to create an API token for the default administrator, jovyan\. It then creates an operating system user in the `jupyterhub` container for each user, assigning an initial password to each that is equal to their user name\. Finally, it calls the REST API operation to create each user in JupyterHub\. It passes the token generated earlier in the script and pipes the REST response to `jq` for easier viewing\.

```
# Bulk add users to container and JupyterHub with temp password of username
set -x
USERS=(shirley diego ana richard li john mary anaya)
TOKEN=$(sudo docker exec jupyterhub /opt/conda/bin/jupyterhub token jovyan | tail -1)
for i in "${USERS[@]}"; 
do 
   sudo docker exec jupyterhub useradd -m -s /bin/bash -N $i
   sudo docker exec jupyterhub bash -c "echo $i:$i | chpasswd"
   curl -XPOST --silent -k https://$(hostname):9443/hub/api/users/$i \
 -H "Authorization: token $TOKEN" | jq
done
```

Save the script to a location in Amazon S3 such as `s3://mybucket/createjupyterusers.sh`\. Then you can use `script-runner.jar` to run it as a step\.
