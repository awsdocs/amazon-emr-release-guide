# About Amazon EMR Releases<a name="emr-release-components"></a>

An Amazon EMR release is a set of open\-source applications from the big\-data ecosystem\. Each release comprises different big\-data applications, components, and features that you select to have Amazon EMR install and configure when you create a cluster\. Applications are packaged using a system based on [Apache BigTop](http://bigtop.apache.org/), which is an open\-source project associated with the Hadoop ecosystem\. This guide provides information for applications included in Amazon EMR releases\.

For more information about getting started and working with Amazon EMR, see the [Amazon EMR Management Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/)\.

When you launch a cluster, you can choose from multiple release versions of Amazon EMR\. This allows you to test and use application versions that fit your compatibility requirements\. You specify the release version using the *release label*\. Release labels are in the form `emr-x.x.x. For example, emr-5.33.0.`

Beginning with Amazon EMR 5\.18\.0, you can use the Amazon EMR artifact repository to build your job code against the exact versions of libraries and dependencies that are available with specific Amazon EMR release versions\. For more information, see [Checking Dependencies Using the Amazon EMR Artifact Repository](emr-artifact-repository.md)\.
