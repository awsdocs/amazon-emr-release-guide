# Ganglia<a name="emr-ganglia"></a>

The Ganglia open source project is a scalable, distributed system designed to monitor clusters and grids while minimizing the impact on their performance\. When you enable Ganglia on your cluster, you can generate reports and view the performance of the cluster as a whole, as well as inspect the performance of individual node instances\. Ganglia is also configured to ingest and visualize Hadoop and Spark metrics\. For more information about the Ganglia open\-source project, go to [http://ganglia\.info/](http://ganglia.info/)\. 

When you view the Ganglia web UI in a browser, you see an overview of the clusterâ€™s performance, with graphs detailing the load, memory usage, CPU utilization, and network traffic of the cluster\. Below the cluster statistics are graphs for each individual server in the cluster\. 

The following table lists the version of Ganglia included in the latest release of Amazon EMR 6\.x series, along with the components that Amazon EMR installs with Ganglia\.

For the version of components installed with Ganglia in this release, see [Release 6\.3\.0 Component Versions](emr-release-6x.md#emr-630-release)\.
